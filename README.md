To run the app, open the terminal in the project's main folder and enter "npm i" to download the project's assets.

Once that is done, in the terminal enter "npm start" to run the app. It will open on port 3000, and the app should open in a new Chrome tab with the url localhost:3000.
Make sure that both ports 5001 (for the api) and 3000 aren't currently used.

Needless to say, it's recommended to run the api first.
